## Assignment
Assignment [assignment 1]: [Module 1 Assignment Instructions -- Classes]

## Encapsulation
[In both Client and BankAccout class, I decleared attributes such as first name, balance, account number, client id as private
in order to make sure they can not be accessed from outside to ensures that the object's state remains consistent and valid.]
